		<h1>Hobbies</h1>

		<p>
			When I'm not at work I like to stay busy and participate in my many interests.  I played a lot of sports as a kid but tennis and skiing are the two that I've kept up with.  In 5th grade I started playing the Euphonium in band class and then taught myself guitar and piano in high-school, but piano has become my favorite to learn and play.  I used to sketch drawings as a kid and have tried to keep that up because I find it relaxing - though I'm not very good.  My interest for computers and programming was kickstarted by my love for videogames as I child and while I turned programming into a career I also don't foresee myself ever stop playing games.

			<h2>Piano</h2>
		  <div>
		    <p>
		    Piano is a great instrument to learn because it's easy to visualize the theory behind how music works.  A trumpet player has to memorize valve combinations and changes the note by changing the air stream that is blown but can only play a note at a time.  With a piano a single person can play a song that sounds full because many harmonies and chords can be played simultaneously.  Scales of notes can be seen in order from lowest frequency to highest.   I think any musician should at least learn a little bit of piano since it makes music theory easier to grasp.

		  <h2>Drawing</h2>
		  <div>
		    <p>
		    	At a young age I used to doodle and sketch drawings and then as a teenager I suddenly stopped.  I remember drawing pictures out of video game magazines and when the game Pokemon came out I compiled a book of drawings of my favorite pokemons.  Recently as an adult I've started to rekindle that interest.  I'm not very good at it but I have improved since I've started.  I find that drawing while listening to music or a podcast can be relaxing and almost meditative.  It seems to activate a part of my mind that is not often used, the nonverbal side, and suppress the chatty and analytic side of my mind that is maybe overused. 
		    </p>
		    <p>
		    	A book that I recieved as a gift a few years ago changed how I viewed drawing and I'd like to think my drawing has improved since. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drawing-Right-Side-Brain-Definitive/dp/1585429201"  target="_blank">"Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain"</a> by Betty Edwards teaches you to turn off your verbal side when you draw.  For example when you draw a person's face you don't want to draw the features like a nose or mouth in a templated way.  You only want to look at the lines, angles, positive and negative space and the relationship of all the lines to eachother and draw what you see.  Forget what you are drawing and only focus on the geometry.  This gets you out of the pattern of drawing a face that looks cartoonish.  This book also made me realize that while there is natural talent at drawing, like everything else, anybody who can draw a single line on a page and practices has the ability to become good at it. 
		    </p>
		    <p>
		    	My return to drawing as an adult reminded me of an interesting video from the TED website that's about why we tend to lose our 'creativity' as adults.
		    	Here is an audo file of that talk.  Hope you enjoy it!

		  <h2>Skiing</h2>
		  <div>
		    <p>
		    	Growing up in Wisconsin, there wasn't a lot of opportunites to ski.  The hill, and yes I mean hill and not mountain, that I learned how to downhill ski on was a converted landfill about 15 minutes away.  They claimed it had 12 runs but it was really 12 different paths of the same run.  Luckily for me after playing ice hockey learning how to ski felt familiar.  My favorite mountain in WI is Granite Peak in Wausau.  I've since branched out of the Midwest and have made a trip to Park City, Utah and recently did a trip to Colorado.  I also had a family trip to Stowe, Vermont as a teen and now that I live in New Hampshire I'm only 2 hours away from the White Mountains.

		  <h2>Programming</h2>
		  <div>
		    <p>
		    	I became fascinated with computers at a young age because of games.  I remember being in middle school and getting my own desktop computer for my bedroom and thinking I was the luckiest kid in the world.  While I used it for school projects and productive things it was always to play computer games in my own mind.  I bought a book, which I can't recall the name of, that was about programming simple 2D games in a langauge created by the author and I was hooked by the power that I could create my own worlds.  In high school I got a TI-83+ calculator and I remember learning how to make a simple number guessing game and thought that it was the coolest even though it was incredibly simple.  I also took a course in highschool on how to build websites but because it was my senior year I didn't pay much attention and lost all the knowledge.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		    	In college my major was in health sciences and I was pursuing Physical Therapy and ended up with a Bachelors in Psychology from the University of Wisconsin - Madison.  My senior year I decided to take a course in programming as an elective and it introduced object-oriented programming in the Java language.  It was a class that I struggled with but I found myself reading chapters in the book that were not even assigned because I thought it was so interesting.  After I graduated I enrolled in a second Bachelors program in Management Information Systems to pursue my interest in computers and software.  I find it extremely challenging and rewarding and enjoy the fact that there's always something new to learn.

		  <h2>Videogames</h2>
		  <div>
		    <p>
		    Videogames have brought a lot of joy in my life.  They flared my creativity as a child and they were an activity that I often shared with friends.  In my lifetime games have gone from primitive 2d sprites to modern games with graphic processing that rivals real life.  The industry has matured and now videogames are mainstream and rival movies as our favorite entertainment venue.  I remember being 4 years old and seeing Mario Bros. on the NES and being entirely transfixed to the world that was on the screen.  The sense of mastery that the game produced as I improved my abilities as Mario to jump around the levels was gratifying.  As I got older and the internet matured I started to play games online.  First it was shooting games with modes similar to playing paintball and eventually Massive Multiplayer Role Playing Games were created where you could have a persistent character in an expansive world full of things to do.  I don't have as much time to play videogames as I did growing up but I still find it as a great way to lose myself for a few hours a week and it still can trigger my child-like sense of playfulness and wonder.

		  <h2>Tennis</h2>
		  <div>
		    <p>
		    	I didn't start playing tennis until I was about 10-11 years old.  Before that my parents signed me up for baseball, soccer, and eventually ice hockey which consumed my life for many years due to the constant traveling that it entailed.  A friend of mine lived next door to a public tennis court and we began to play once in awhile.  It wasn't until I took a tennis class in a summer school program that I began to fall in love with the sport.  In middle school I joined a tennis club and took lessons in the winter and played at our neighborhood court in the summer.  I was lucky that my best friends also loved and played the sport so I always had hitting partners.  It was the only sport I participated in high school and in my first year of college I played on the Division 3 team at the Milwaukee School of Engineering.  The great thing about Tennis is you can play it for the rest of your life.  It's a great way to exercies and socialize with a friend.

		    <p>
		    	The technique in tennis that differentiates a beginner from a "tennis player" is the ability to hit top-spin shots.  This causes the tennis ball to spin forward which will make it drop to the ground faster and then to bounce up higher.  It increases the pace that the ball can be hit at and causes the ball to feel "heavier" when your opponent hits it back.
